# auto restart the filter on failures

# specifies the filter's maximum restart rate, if restarts begin to happen faster than this rate, the filter will terminate; 10/1h - 10 restarts/hour are allowed at most

# defines the canonicalization methods used at message signing, the simple method allows almost no modification while the relaxed one tolerates minor changes such as 
whitespace replacement; relaxed/simple - the message header will be processed with the relaxed algorithm and the body with the simple one
Canonicalization        relaxed/relaxed
