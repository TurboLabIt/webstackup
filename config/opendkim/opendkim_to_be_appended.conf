# auto restart the filter on failures
AutoRestart             Yes

# specifies the filter's maximum restart rate, if restarts begin to happen faster than this rate, the filter will terminate; 10/1h - 10 restarts/hour are allowed at most

# Log via calls to syslog(3) additional entries indicating successful signing or verification of messages.

SyslogSuccess           Yes

#If logging is enabled (see Syslog below), issues very detailed logging about the logic behind the filterâ€™s decision to either sign a message or verify it.
#LogWhy                  Yes

# defines the canonicalization methods used at message signing, the simple method allows almost no modification while the relaxed one tolerates minor changes such as whitespace replacement; relaxed/simple - the message header will be processed with the relaxed algorithm and the body with the simple one
Canonicalization        relaxed/relaxed
