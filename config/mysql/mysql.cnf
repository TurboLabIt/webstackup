## Various MySQL optimization

[mysqld]

## Disable MySQL name resolution
# Warning: "localhost" MAY fail. Use 127.0.0.1 instead
skip_name_resolve


## Rise the max_connections limit

#
# Example
# -------
# Total buffers: 168.0M global + 65.1M per thread (250 max threads)
# Maximum possible memory usage: 16.1G (51.38% of installed RAM)
max_connections = 250


## The size in bytes of the buffer pool, the memory area where InnoDB caches table and index data. 
# https://dba.stackexchange.com/a/27341
# First run this query
# ---
# SELECT CEILING(Total_InnoDB_Bytes*1.6/POWER(1024,3)) RIBPS FROM
# (SELECT SUM(data_length+index_length) Total_InnoDB_Bytes
# FROM information_schema.tables WHERE engine='InnoDB') A;
# ---
# This will give you the RIBPS, Recommended InnoDB Buffer Pool Size, based on all InnoDB Data and Indexes, with an additional 60%.
