### VARIOUS MYSQL OPTIMIZATION BY WEBSTACK.UP
## for a 32GB RAM server with nginx+mysql

[mysqld]

## Disable MySQLx
# itâ€™s a way to name the crossover between relational and document models 
# https://www.percona.com/blog/2019/01/07/understanding-mysql-x-all-flavors/
mysqlx = OFF

## MySQL MUST listen only to localhost!
bind-address = 127.0.0.1
mysqlx-bind-address = 127.0.0.1


## MySQL legacy auth plugin
# The caching_sha2_password plugin will be supported in a future PHP release.

## Disable MySQL name resolution
# Warning: "localhost" MAY fail. Use 127.0.0.1 instead
#skip_name_resolve


## Rise the max_connections limit
# https://serverfault.com/questions/92056/how-to-find-out-the-memory-cost-of-each-mysql-connection
#
# Example
# -------
# Total buffers: 168.0M global + 65.1M per thread (250 max threads)
# Maximum possible memory usage: 16.1G (51.38% of installed RAM)
# 
# Check: select @@max_connections;
max_connections = 250


## The size in bytes of the buffer pool, the memory area where InnoDB caches table and index data. 
# https://dba.stackexchange.com/a/27341
# First run this query
# ---
# SELECT CEILING(Total_InnoDB_Bytes*1.6/POWER(1024,3)) RIBPS FROM
# (SELECT SUM(data_length+index_length) Total_InnoDB_Bytes
# FROM information_schema.tables WHERE engine='InnoDB') A;
# ---
# This will give you the RIBPS, Recommended InnoDB Buffer Pool Size, based on all InnoDB Data and Indexes, with an additional 60%.
innodb_buffer_pool_size = 2G


##
# the log file size should be set as big as possible, but not bigger than necessary.
# A bigger log file size is better for performance, but it has a drawback (a significant one) that you need to worry about: the recovery time after a crash
# https://www.percona.com/blog/2016/05/31/what-is-a-big-innodb_log_file_size/
#
# InnoDB total log files size equals to 25% of buffer pool size
innodb_log_file_size = 500MB
