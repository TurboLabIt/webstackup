## MySQL MUST listen only to localhost!

## MySQL legacy auth plugin
# The caching_sha2_password plugin will be supported in a future PHP release.

## Disable MySQL name resolution
# Warning: "localhost" MAY fail. Use 127.0.0.1 instead

## Rise the max_connections limit
# https://serverfault.com/questions/92056/how-to-find-out-the-memory-cost-of-each-mysql-connection
#
# Example
# -------
# Total buffers: 168.0M global + 65.1M per thread (250 max threads)
# Maximum possible memory usage: 16.1G (51.38% of installed RAM)
# 
# Check: select @@max_connections;
max_connections = 250


## The size in bytes of the buffer pool, the memory area where InnoDB caches table and index data.

# First run this query
# ---
# SELECT CEILING(Total_InnoDB_Bytes*1.6/POWER(1024,3)) RIBPS FROM
# (SELECT SUM(data_length+index_length) Total_InnoDB_Bytes
# FROM information_schema.tables WHERE engine='InnoDB') A;
# ---
# This will give you the RIBPS, Recommended InnoDB Buffer Pool Size, based on all InnoDB Data and Indexes, with an additional 60%.

# the log file size should be set as big as possible, but not bigger than necessary.
# A bigger log file size is better for performance, but it has a drawback (a significant one) that you need to worry about: the recovery time after a crash
# https://www.percona.com/blog/2016/05/31/what-is-a-big-innodb_log_file_size/
innodb_log_file_size = 512M


##
# If innodb_buffer_pool_size is set to more than 1GB, innodb_buffer_pool_instances divides 
# the InnoDB buffer pool into a specific number of instances.
# Each instance manages its own data structures and takes an equal portion of the total buffer pool size, 
# so for example if innodb_buffer_pool_size is 4GB and innodb_buffer_pool_instances is set to 4, each 
# instance will be 1GB. Each instance should ideally be at least 1GB in size.
